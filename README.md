In this paper, the performance of three deep learning methods for predicting short-term evolution of a multi-scale spatio-temporal Lorenz 96 system is examined. 
Here includes the code of two methods ANN and RC-ESN. Also, a data set of normalized Lorenz 96 equation is provided for execution. The ANN code is supported by keras and backend on TensorFlow

We are thankful to Pantelis Vlachas and Jaideep Pathak for sharing the open-source codes for the comparisons. We are grateful to ashesh chattopadhyay for sharing the open-source code and helping us execution part of the code.
We also thank our guides for supporting us.
